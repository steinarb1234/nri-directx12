# Nvidia NRI - Odin - Tests

This is my test game made using Nvidia NRI in Odin. 

Dependencies: 
- [NRI-odin](https://github.com/lodinukal/NRI-odin)
- SDL3 vendor library

Note: You may have to set device validation to false for the device creation to work, depending on if you have the Windows Graphics tools enabled. It should be set to false for release builds.
