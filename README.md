# Nvidia NRI - Odin - Tests

This repo is my test for using Nvidia NRI in Odin. 

Dependencies: 
- [NRI-odin](https://github.com/lodinukal/NRI-odin) (I am using a modified version that is compiled with imgui enabled)
- SDL3 vendor library
- Odin Imgui bindings

Note: If you want to enable device validation you need to have Windows Graphics tools enabled. It should be disabled for release builds since it causes lag.
