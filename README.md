# Nvidia NRI - Odin - Tests

This repo is my test for using Nvidia NRI in Odin. 

Dependencies: 
- [NRI-odin](https://github.com/lodinukal/NRI-odin)
- SDL3 vendor library
- Odin Imgui bindings (currently working on implementing the 1.92 version with SDL3)

Note: You may have to set device validation to false for the device creation to work, depending on if you have the Windows Graphics tools enabled. It should be set to false for release builds since it causes lag.
